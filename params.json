JVoid is here to rescue you and your team from the dreaded world of waiting for tests to complete.\r\n\r\nUsing extremely intelligent hacks^C^C^C^C^C algorithms, JVoid keeps track of modifications to your codebase and makes sure that **only** the tests relevant for those modifications are executed. Basically it skips all the tests whose outcome would not be altered by your changes to the code.\r\n\r\n# Supported Test Frameworks\r\n\r\nThe test frameworks currently supported by jVoid are:\r\n\r\n* JUnit4\r\n* Spock\r\n\r\nTestNG will be supported in future releases.",
